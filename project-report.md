## Dataset

Stars are the birthplaces of planets, and their properties—like mass, temperature, and spectral type—can significantly influence the characteristics of orbiting planets. Understanding how planetary systems vary across different types of stars can give us insights into planet formation, system evolution, and even where life might be more likely to exist. With thousands of discovered exoplanets, we can now visualize patterns in real data to better understand our cosmic neighborhood.  I have always been interested in planets and stars and want to learn more about it through visualizing it.

The Planetary Systems Composite Parameters Planet Data table (PSCompPars) is a compilation of system, stellar, and planetary parameters for known Confirmed Exoplanets. The purpose of this table is to enable a more statistical view of the known exoplanet population and their host environments.  I am using the different features such as stellar temperature, stellar mass, planet's equilibrium temperature, and Stellar Types (Type of Star a planet is orbitting).

(NASA Exoplanet Archive data comes from a combination of sources and is curated by NASA and Caltech/IPAC (Infrared Processing and Analysis Center))

## How does the number of known planets vary across different spectral types of stars?

## How does a planet’s equilibrium temperature relate to its host star’s mass and temperature?
